## Change Log Summary

* 5.0.0: Rebuilt to target Umbraco 16 Management Apis and uUI framework now an RCL (See breaking changes below)
* 4.0.0: Rebuilt with Umbraco's uUI targetting Umbraco 15+
* 3.0.0: Removed support for Umbraco 8 & 9, allowing us to cleanup the codebase.  *Now a Razor Class Library.*
* 2.1.3: Better support for installation on Umbraco 11.
* 2.1.0: Breaking change - `MapConfig.Zoom` is now an `int` as it should be (was a `string`).
* 2.0.7: Added ability to re-center the map via Editor Actions and can now directly input a set of coordinates.

## Breaking Changes

* As of version 5, the Our.Umbraco.GMaps.Core package is no longer, and any references to `Our.Umbraco.GMaps.Core` should be replaced with just `Our.Umbraco.GMaps`.

## Features

* Targeting Umbraco 15+
* Search for address using autocomplete and place marker
* Enter coordinates in place marker
* Click on exact location on map to place marker
* Drag marker around
* Set default location & zoomlevel on Data Type settings
* Zoomlevel is saved on the property to use the same zoomlevel on your website
* Centerpoint is saved on the property to use the same centerpoint on your website different than the marker.
* MapType is saved on the property to use the same maptype on your website
* Use your SnazzyMaps API key to set mapstyles

## Install

Use NuGet to install Our.Umbraco.GMaps:

## Configuration

You can configure the API Key along with other settings directly in AppSettings as per below:

These settings can be overridden by configuring the relevant properties of the Data Type prevalues.
